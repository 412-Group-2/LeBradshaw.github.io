	 <h1> $450 Million Raised to Boost Ethereum Scaling and Web3 </h1> 
         <p> The Ethereum blockchain scaling solution Polygon today said it has raised $450 million 
		  in new funding led by Sequoia Capital India, which the company intends to use to expand 
		  its services and web3 capabilities.
		</p>
         <p> Web3 refers to the decentralized web, which uses blockchain technology to create peer-to-peer 
		  networks and token economies where financial transactions can be executed without the 
		  need for middlemen. Blockchain networks underlie cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum.
		</p>
	 <p> 
	 <cite> “Web3 builds on the early internet’s open-source ideals, enabling users to create value, control the network and 
		 reap the rewards. Ethereum, scaled by Polygon, will be the bedrock of this next stage in the web’s evolution.”
	         </cite>
		 Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said in a statement.
