<h3> Personal Transportation faces Technological Disruption</h3>
	   <p> <cite>Before the pandemic, personal transportation was mostly focused on cars with air transport,
		human powered transport, and even motorcycles largely falling into different classes. 
		But with the increased use of video conferencing and collaboration products like Zoom, Teams, and Webex,
		   the need for business travel has taken a significant hit.</cite></p>
	   <p> While we are currently still a travelling people, recent events have showed us we need to recondisder our means of travel, for both our safety and convenience.
		In light of Covid-19 delivery options have expanded, as well as remote communcations with teachers, doctors, merchants and more. Services like Amazon, and Ebay
		   make it so we dont really need to leave the house to get items we need.</p>
	   <p> <cite>When cars become truly autonomous, why will we need to own one for the few times we have to leave our homes?</cite>
		Soon, all it will take is a call to Uber for an autonomous shuttle to get you from point A to B, so why would you need to own a car?
	   <p><cite>We haven’t even begun to talk about flying cars and people-carrying drones, both of which are advancing very quickly.
		Once vehicles are autonomous, we won’t need professional drivers or driver’s licenses because humans won’t be driving.</cite></p>
