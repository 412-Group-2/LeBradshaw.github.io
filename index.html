          <h2> Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly </h2>
          <p> The Alice, a plane developed by Israeli company Eviation, went through engine testing last week, and according to the Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, 
		  the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight. The nine pasenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, or 440 nautical miles. The company
		orginally aimed for Alice to take flight before 2122, but poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest hindered testing.</p>
          <p> Growing electric aviation startups and established aviation companies and donations to those copmapies (if any): </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NASA gave $253 million to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to the US by 2035.</li>
            <li>Boeing is investing $450 in Wish Aero, who is building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft.</li>
	    <li>Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavours since 2010.</li>
	  </ul>  
	  <p>Electric aviation proponents predict Alice and electric planes like it becoming as commonplace as any other means of transportation. <cite>"It really 
		  integrates aviation into the fabric of transportation, of our commuter life. It does so while being sustainable, and through being 
		  economically viable," said Bar-Yohay. "Once we start seeing planes like this, the entire way we look at where we live, how we commute, 
		  how we go on vacation, will change. It will be a high-speed train without the rail." </cite></p>

	   <h3> Personal Transportation faces Technological Disruption</h3>
	   <p> <cite>Before the pandemic, personal transportation was mostly focused on cars with air transport,
		human powered transport, and even motorcycles largely falling into different classes. 
		But with the increased use of video conferencing and collaboration products like Zoom, Teams, and Webex,
		   the need for business travel has taken a significant hit.</cite></p>
	   <p> While we are currently still a travelling people, recent events have showed us we need to recondisder our means of travel, for both our safety and convenience.
		In light of Covid-19 delivery options have expanded, as well as remote communcations with teachers, doctors, merchants and more. Services like Amazon, and Ebay
		   make it so we dont really need to leave the house to get items we need.</p>
	   <p> <cite>When cars become truly autonomous, why will we need to own one for the few times we have to leave our homes?</cite>
		Soon, all it will take is a call to Uber for an autonomous shuttle to get you from point A to B, so why would you need to own a car?
	   <p><cite>We haven’t even begun to talk about flying cars and people-carrying drones, both of which are advancing very quickly.
		Once vehicles are autonomous, we won’t need professional drivers or driver’s licenses because humans won’t be driving.</cite></p>
