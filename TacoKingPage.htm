<p> I am Ben Bradshaw. I am called the Taco King. I earned this title when a motorist vandalized my Taco Bell
 resturaunt. I saw that the AC unit on his camper had been damaged in 
the collision. I went to RV repair facilities to find the culprit. This 
action saved the store $4000. My area coach was so impresed that I was given a custom shirt and hat to wear. I love my job.

I like to go to garage sales. I am  very poor
 so that's the best way for me to get stuff. most of my belongings are 
secondhand. I don't care though. I have a very nice computer, extensive 
lego star wars collection, exquisite selection of Edgar Rice Burroughs first editions,
 and more. Sometimes I even sell things I find. Since my room is small I
 mostly buy stuff to give away now. This has made me very popular with 
my friends.
